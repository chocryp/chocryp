<p id="Bannertext"></b>A critical bug happened with interaction between contracts. Do not use any of the vaults or the contracts. We have processed numerous refunds and are still going through the list.
      Thank you for your support and patience. We are also working with 2 additional devs on a potential fix and a future version of the contract and dapp. We are sorry.<b></p>
