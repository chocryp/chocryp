     A critical bug happened with interaction between contracts. Do not use any of the vaults or the contracts. We have processed numerous refunds and are still going through the list.<br>  Thank you for your support and patience. 

We are also working with 2 additional devs on a potential fix and a future version of the contract and dapp.  We are sorry.
